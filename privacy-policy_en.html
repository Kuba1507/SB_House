                        user's terminal device. With regard to information about the user's preferences collected by the
                        advertising network
                        Google, the user can view and edit the information resulting from the cookies using the

                        use of the Website. Cookies usually contain the name of the website
                        from which they originate, the time of storing them on the terminal equipment and a unique
                        number.</li>
                    <li>The entity placing cookies on the terminal equipment of a Service User and
                        accessing them is the operator of the Website.</li>
                    <li>Cookies are used for the following purposes:

                    <li>There are two main types of cookies used on the Website: ‘session cookies’ (session cookies)
                        and ‘permanent’ (persistent cookies). Session’ cookies are temporary files which
                        are stored on the User's terminal equipment until they log off, leave the website or switch off
                        the software (web browser).
                        website or until the software (web browser) is switched off. ‘Permanent’ cookies
                        are stored on the User's terminal equipment for the time specified in the parameters of the
                        cookies
                        cookies or until they are deleted by the User.</li>
                    <li>Web browsing software (internet browser) usually
                        allows cookies to be stored on the User's terminal equipment by default. Users of

                    <li>Restrictions on the use of cookies may affect some of the functionality available on the
                        Website.</li>
                    <li>Cookies placed in the Service User's terminal equipment may be used
                        also by entities cooperating with the operator of the Service, in particular these companies:
                        Google (Google Inc. based in the USA), Facebook (Facebook Inc. based in the USA), Twitter
                        (Twitter Inc. based in the USA).</li>
